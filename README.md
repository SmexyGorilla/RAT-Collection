# RAT-Collection

A fork of https://github.com/Cryakl/Ultimate-RAT-Collection/ but with a Python script that allows users to download the files to their machine easily. This was not intended to be a fork, but it is needed for the security (i.e. not being deleted/removed) of the files that downloader.py can access.

### Credits
[Cryakl](https://github.com/cryakl) for the Trojan samples
